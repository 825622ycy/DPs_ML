probe method, representing open circuit, short circuit, deionized water, methanol, and ethanol, respectively. The files s_normal_N1–5.txt 
and s_tumor_N1–5.txt contain the simulated reflection coefficients of normal and tumor tissues, respectively, across five thicknesses ranging 
from 0.1 mm to 0.9 mm, within the frequency range of 1 GHz to 4 GHz.
